# React Native 

## Overview 

**React** is a JavaScript framework from Facebook. They describe it as: 

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is the View in MVC.

> React : verb, respond or behave in a particular way in response to something.

React responds to changes. Isn't this what a user interface should do? React is similar 
to MVC but is also very different. React UI is built in a Component based architecture. 
Components.

> Component : noun, a part or element of a larger whole, especially a part of a machine 
> or vehicle.

Apps are broken down into components. Components can get very granular representing 
even very small parts of your interfaces. Components by definition are small parts 
that are assembled to make larger system. Components will often be made of more components!

Components are configured with **props** (short for properties) and **state**. 

> Properties : an essential or distinctive attribute or quality of a thing

Properties configure a component supplying information that can make any instance of 
a component unqiue.

> State : the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time.

State holds the condition of a component in time. As state changes a component changes. 
Changing the state of a component will cause a component to redraw itself.

**React Native** is described as:

> A framework for building native apps using React

React is a JavaScript framework for creating Native apps. It is built on React, it uses 
React as an underlying framework. Even though React Native is written in  JavaScript it 
still produces native apps.

## Why Use React Native? 

The biggest advantage to React Native is the ability to use a single code base to write 
apps for Android and iOS. With smaller apps you should be able to achieve this. With 
larger apps you should still be able to write a majority of your once for both 
Android and iOS, though there is likely to be situations where you will need to write 
some amount of code for specific to each platform. 

## Does it work on Mac? 

Yes. You can build for Android and iOS on a Mac. Sadly you can not build iOS on Windows. 

To build for iOS you will need to have Xcode installed. 

To build for Android you need to install:

- Java SE Dev Kit 8
- Android Studio

## Wait I'm Making native apps with JavaScript?

Yep.

## But, how does that work? 

Magic.
