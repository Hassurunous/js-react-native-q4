# React Native - Cross Platform app dev

Learn to build native iOS and Android apps using React, Redux, and JavaScript.  

## Course Overview 

Taking this course you will learn to create iOS and Android apps from a single codebase 
written in JavaScript. You will learn React Native a frame for building truly native 
apps from JavaScript. Using React you will build apps using a component architecture and 
unidirectional data flow. This is an interesting alternative to traditional MVC 
architectures. You will manage app state using Redux. Redux is predictable state container 
built from functional programming concepts. 

## Prerequisites 

To get the most out of this class you must have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. While you don't have to be an advanced JavaScript programming, you need to 
have a good understanding of basic JavaScript syntax, methods, and objects. 

FEW 101 would be a good prerequisite.  

## Competencies & Outcomes

1. Build apps using a Reactive paradigm. 
2. Use a single code base to deploy apps to multiple platforms. 
3. Construct applications using a component based architecture. 
4. Implement apps built around a functional state container.
